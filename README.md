# Coffee Thoughts

Coffee Thoughts is a short piece inspired by the soothing feeling I get from making coffee each morning. My goal was to express a positive, somewhat up-tempo, relaxed vibe. This stems from coffee's relaxing and energizing nature; it is relaxing to make, but also wakes me up a bit. Leveraging a little bit of music theory (majors are happy, inverting chords for variety), I was able to get at this feeling. Making coffee, as displayed in my video, is also a very consistent process, and I tried to reflect this in my song, with consistent themes, completed by slight etheral variation.
